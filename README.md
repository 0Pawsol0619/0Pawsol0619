I am a highly skilled **Web3 and Blockchain AI Developer** with over 8 years of experience in cutting-edge technologies. With a strong background in full-stack development (3+ years) and blockchain development (5+ years), I have successfully built and delivered innovative solutions across multiple domains.
My expertise spans front-end and back-end web development, blockchain architecture, and smart contract development. Recently, I have been specializing in Solana development, focusing on Solana bots and AI-driven Solana agents.
